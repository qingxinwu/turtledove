# Introduction # {#intro}

<em>This section is non-normative</em>

The FLEDGE API facilitates selecting an advertisement to display to a user based on a previous
interaction with the advertiser or advertising network.

When a user's interactions with an advertiser indicate an interest in something, the advertiser can
ask the browser to record this interest on-device by calling
{{Window/navigator}}.{{Navigator/joinAdInterestGroup()}}. Later, when a website wants to select an
advertisement to show to the user, the website can call
{{Window/navigator}}.{{Navigator/runAdAuction()}} to ask the browser to conduct an auction where
each of these on-device recorded interests are given the chance to calculate a bid to display their
advertisement.


<h2 id="joining-interest-groups">Joining Interest Groups</h2>

When a user's interactions with a website indicate that the user may have a particular interest, an
advertiser or someone working on behalf of the advertiser (e.g. a demand side platform, DSP) can ask
the user's browser to record this interest on-device by calling
{{Window/navigator}}.{{Navigator/joinAdInterestGroup()}}. This indicates an intent to display an
advertisement relevant to this interest to this user in the future. The user agent has an
<dfn>interest group set</dfn>, a [=list=] of [=interest groups=] in which
[=interest group/owner=] / [=interest group/name=] pairs are unique.

# Permissions Policy integration # {#permissions-policy-integration}

This specification defines two [=policy-controlled features=] identified by the string
"<code><dfn noexport>join-ad-interest-group</dfn></code>", and
"<code><dfn noexport>run-ad-auction</dfn></code>". Their [=policy-controlled feature/default allowlists=] are `'self'`.

Note: In the Chromium implementation the [=policy-controlled feature/default allowlists=] for both features are
temporarily set to `*` to ease testing.

: <dfn>owner</dfn>
:: An [=url/origin=].
: <dfn>name</dfn>

  when the number of interest groups are limited by {{AuctionAdConfig/perBuyerGroupLimits}}.

:: Null or an [=ordered map=] whose [=map/keys=] are [=strings=] and whose [=map/values=] are
  {{double}}. Its dot product with the {{AuctionAdConfig/perBuyerPrioritySignals}} will be used
  in place of [=interest group/priority=], if set.
: <dfn>priority signals overrides</dfn>
:: Null or an [=ordered map=] whose [=map/keys=] are [=strings=] and whose [=map/values=] are

: <dfn>bidding url</dfn>
:: Null or a [=URL=]. The URL to fetch the buyer's Javascript from.
: <dfn>bidding wasm helper url</dfn>
:: Null or a [=URL=]. Lets the bidder provide computationally-expensive subroutines in WebAssembly,
  rather than JavaScript, to be driven from the JavaScript function provided by
  [=interest group/bidding url=].

:: Null or a [=URL=]. Provides a mechanism for the group's owner to periodically update the
  attributes of the interest group.
: <dfn>trusted bidding signals url</dfn>

  time.

:: Null or a [=list=] of [=interest group ad=]. Contains various ads that the interest group might
  show.
: <dfn>ad components</dfn>
:: Null or a [=list=] of [=interest group ad=]. Contains various ad components (or "products") that
  can be used to construct ads composed of multiple pieces — a top-level ad template "container"
  which includes some slots that can be filled in with specific "products".
: <dfn>joining origin</dfn>
:: An [=url/origin=].The top level page origin from where the interest group was joined.
